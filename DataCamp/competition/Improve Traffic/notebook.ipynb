{"cells":[{"source":"# Can you find a better way to manage traffic?\n\n## 📖 Background\nTraffic congestion is an issue faced by urban centers. The complexity of managing traffic increases every year due to several reasons, this is bad because it generates higher fuel consumption, and increased emissions. In the New York City (NY), the complexity is even higher, in NY there are exceptional complex road network. Efficiently managing traffic flow in such a bustling environment is crucial.\n\nThis challenge gives you an opportunity to try to relieve traffic congestions in NY. We analyze historical traffic and weather data. The end game/goal is to identify factors that contribute to congestion, we do this with Data Analytics and to develop a predictive model that forecasts traffic volumes based on these factors.","metadata":{},"id":"6671fb82-1962-44c1-aa4f-4e44883b3832","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## 💾 The data\n\nThe data for this analysis is based on three key datasets:\n\nTraffic Data (train and test tables):\n\ntrain table: Contains detailed information on individual taxi trips, including:\n- the start and end times\n- the number of passengers\n- the GPS coordinates of pickup and dropoff locations.\n\n\n_The target variable_ is the trip duration.\ntest table: This table is similar to the train table, but _without_ the trip duration, this data will be used to test the predictive model.\n\nWeather Data (weather table):\n\nHistorical weather data corresponding to the dates in the traffic data, including: \n- temperature\n- precipitation\n- snowfall\n- snow depth\n\nAs of the complete *Metadata* of the tables, you can find the following information:\nThe data for this competition is stored in the following tables, \"train\", \"test\" and \"weather\".\n\n- train \n\nThis table contains training data with features and target variable:\n\n**id**: Unique identifier for each trip.\n\n**vendor_id**: Identifier for the taxi vendor.\n\n**pickup_datetime**: Date and time when the trip started.\n\n**dropoff_datetime**: Date and time when the trip ended.\n\n**passenger_count**: Number of passengers in the taxi.\n\n**pickup_longitude**: Longitude of the pickup location.\n\n**pickup_latitude**: Latitude of the pickup location.\n\n**dropoff_longitude**: Longitude of the dropoff location.\n\n**dropoff_latitude**: Latitude of the dropoff location.\n\n**store_and_fwd_flag**: Indicates if the trip data was stored and forwarded.\n\n**trip_duration**: Duration of the trip in seconds.\n\n- test \n\nThis table is very similar to the train table but in the test data there is no target variable.\n\n- weather \n\nThis table contains historical weather data for New York City.\n\n**date**: Date of the weather record (should match the pickup and dropoff dates in the traffic data).\n\n**maximum temperature**: Maximum temperature of the day in Celsius.\n\n**minimum temperature**: Minimum temperature of the day in Celsius.\n\n**average temperature**: Average temperature of the day in Celsius.\n\n**precipitation**: Total precipitation of the day in millimeters.\n\n**snow fall**: Snowfall of the day in millimeters.\n\n**snow depth**: Snow depth of the day in millimeters.\n\nA \"T\" in the **snow depth** field stands for a \"trace\" amount of snow. This means that snowfall was observed, but the amount was too small to be measured accurately, less than 0.1 inches.\n\nIn the dataset, the **store_and_fwd_flag** field indicates whether a taxi trip record was stored in the vehicle's memory before sending to the server due to a temporary loss of connection. The value \"N\" stands for \"No,\" meaning that the trip data was not stored and was sent directly to the server in real-time. Conversely, the value \"Y\" stands for \"Yes,\" indicating that the trip data was stored temporarily before being forwarded to the server.","metadata":{},"id":"2f5929b9-9d9a-457a-99ab-be05f27176f9","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load datasets\ntraffic_data = pd.read_csv('data/train.csv')\n\n\n# Convert date columns to datetime\ntraffic_data['pickup_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(traffic_data['pickup_datetime'])\ntraffic_data['dropoff_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(traffic_data['dropoff_datetime'])\n\n# Display the first few rows of the traffic data\ntraffic_data.head(5)","metadata":{"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":235,"type":"dataFrame"}},"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":179,"lastExecutedAt":1723194668445,"lastExecutedByKernel":"fb201daf-c23b-4d8b-98de-0031c40ba4e6","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load datasets\ntraffic_data = pd.read_csv('data/train.csv')\n\n\n# Convert date columns to datetime\ntraffic_data['pickup_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(traffic_data['pickup_datetime'])\ntraffic_data['dropoff_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(traffic_data['dropoff_datetime'])\n\n# Display the first few rows of the traffic data\ntraffic_data.head(5)"},"id":"07ee76ec-6cc0-4cc7-b6ed-eba4feb6ca0b","cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"id","type":"string"},{"name":"vendor_id","type":"integer"},{"name":"pickup_datetime","type":"datetime"},{"name":"dropoff_datetime","type":"datetime"},{"name":"passenger_count","type":"integer"},{"name":"pickup_longitude","type":"number"},{"name":"pickup_latitude","type":"number"},{"name":"dropoff_longitude","type":"number"},{"name":"dropoff_latitude","type":"number"},{"name":"store_and_fwd_flag","type":"string"},{"name":"trip_duration","type":"integer"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0,1,2,3,4],"id":["id2875421","id2377394","id3858529","id3504673","id2181028"],"vendor_id":[2,1,2,2,2],"pickup_datetime":["2016-03-14T17:24:55.000","2016-06-12T00:43:35.000","2016-01-19T11:35:24.000","2016-04-06T19:32:31.000","2016-03-26T13:30:55.000"],"dropoff_datetime":["2016-03-14T17:32:30.000","2016-06-12T00:54:38.000","2016-01-19T12:10:48.000","2016-04-06T19:39:40.000","2016-03-26T13:38:10.000"],"passenger_count":[1,1,1,1,1],"pickup_longitude":[-73.9821548462,-73.9804153442,-73.9790267944,-74.0100402832,-73.9730529785],"pickup_latitude":[40.7679367065,40.7385635376,40.7639389038,40.7199707031,40.7932090759],"dropoff_longitude":[-73.964630127,-73.9994812012,-74.0053329468,-74.0122680664,-73.9729232788],"dropoff_latitude":[40.7656021118,40.7311515808,40.7100868225,40.7067184448,40.7825202942],"store_and_fwd_flag":["N","N","N","N","N"],"trip_duration":[455,663,2124,429,435]}},"total_rows":5,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"          id  vendor_id  ... store_and_fwd_flag trip_duration\n0  id2875421          2  ...
